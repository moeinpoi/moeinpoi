## Moein Naderi, Ph.D.

- Hi, I'm a Postdoctoral Research Associate at [Peng Lab](https://peng.lab.uic.edu/myresearch/) at [UIC](https://bme.uic.edu).
- I’m currently working on porting the LAMMPS code to Kokkos for GPU-accelerated biophysics simulations.

- I also have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@moeinpoi) where I post (not really consistently) tutorial on COMSOL Multiphysics.
